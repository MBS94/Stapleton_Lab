Found the top 10 significant genes. With absolute value of avg(A) - avg(B)

"IDP3914"  "mmp195g"  "mmp177c"
"umc2087"  "lim333"   "gpm662b"
"bnl5.46c" "IDP2349"  "gpm296c"  "IDP574"  

Created a simulation of two genes, all possible combinations. 00, 01, 10, 11.
Observations of each of the 8 different env stress combonations with the 4 distinct gene combos

Created simulated Heights based on the equation,

H = a + env_coeff * env + g1_coeff * g1 + g2_coeff * g2 + error

Attempted running through vQTL scanonevar, ran into some errors.

Removed, return covar effects. No errors, but unhelpful results. All NAs

Next steps is to debug vQTL problems and create larger simulated data.
