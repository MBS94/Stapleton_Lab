# Reports for Dr. Stapleton Lab

### 2018/January/15

- Worked with Jessica to run vQTL on the Random/Family data with a new covariate column
- We were successful in running the code on a small subset of the data
- Plan to run the code on the full data set 2018/01/22
- Now the 2018/06/01 qPCR Data is separated, begin moving towards writing adjustment code for the calibration data

### 2018/January/17

- Started working on writing R code for calibration adjustment that is more robust
- Worked with Julia to help with the data wrangling process for the MO#'s
- Wrote a Python script to do some of the data wrangling, the process works except for a few MO#
